**1. INTRODUCTION**

Before Docker, developers and testers in the programming industry had a difficult time transporting data between environments. This presents a number of challenges as well as drawbacks for the developer and tester. How to overcome this problem? 

Introducing Docker is one of the solutions. Docker can be thought of as a tool that optimizes the deployment of applications in lightweight containers, allowing them to run efficiently in a variety of environments. By definition, a container is a software package that includes all of the requirements needed to run an application.
