**1. INTRODUCTION**

Before Docker, developers and testers in the programming industry had a difficult time transporting data between environments. This presents a number of challenges as well as drawbacks for the developer and tester. How to overcome this problem? 

Introducing Docker is one of the solutions. Docker can be thought of as a tool that optimizes the deployment of applications in lightweight containers, allowing them to run efficiently in a variety of environments. By definition, a container is a software package that includes all of the requirements needed to run an application.

For instance, if a chalet has four bedrooms but only one of them has a toilet, this could be a problem because the guests will not have convenient access to the toilet. This is where Docker steps in to help address the issue. To ensure that each room is comfortable, the owner must install a toilet in each room. In this example, toilet refers to the framework. By including a framework in every software application (room), the application will run more smoothly. Thus, Docker will assist in running the application with the appropriate framework.

When compared to virtual machines, Docker has a number of advantages. One of them is Docker, which is lighter than virtual machines but still provides the same functionality. In addition, as compared to virtual machines, Docker consumes less RAM and requires a faster application boot-up time. Apart from that, Docker has a slightly higher efficiency because it is freely accessible across multiple platforms. Finally, the Docker environment provides superior and consistent performance.
